	- Added name, generate, bank and holeydma for sequences (for easier bankswitching management)
  - For lonely and consecutive tiles, automatically switch to immediate mode
	- Introduced pregeneration of immediate sequences
	- Better tileset optimizations (look for a tileet within existing stored
	tilesets)

	- Fixed a bug with tiled image width not matching the actual image width

v0.3.7 (06/28/2024) :
	- Refactored code to better mix immediate & tiled modes
	- Better tileset optimization
	- Changed default maxsize (to 31 and 15 depending on tile widthsize (to 31
	and 15 depending on tile width. Assumes 160A/320A modes)
